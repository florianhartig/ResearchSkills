#Experimental Design

In an experiment, we deliberately change one or more process variables (or factors) in order to observe the effect the changes have on one or more response variables. The (statistical) design of experiments (DOE) is an efficient procedure for planning experiments so that the data obtained can be analyzed to yield valid and objective conclusions.

## Reproducibility 

Reproducibility means that methods of a study are described in sufficient detail to follow each step

## The replication crisis 

Replicability means that a second, independent study with the same methods would arrive at the same results as the original study. The term "replication crisis" refers to the phenomenon in recent years that many influential studies / theories that seemed to be replicable didn't replicate once a completely controlled and statistical sound experiment was conducted. Examples:
