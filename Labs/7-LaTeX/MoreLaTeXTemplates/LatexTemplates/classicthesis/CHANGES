Changes in version 4.1 (August 2012)
o Working towards XeLaTeX support:
	- "ifxetex" package for checking whether
	  XeTeX is in use (classicthesis.sty)
	- Adjusted part, chapter, and tocEntry 
	- Thanks to Joerg Weber for his ideas and code
	- Option "pdfspacing" does not work for XeTeX
	  and is disabled when XeTeX is running
	  (maybe implement spacing with fontspec later)
o Load additional packages in order to 
  reduce warnings (classicthesis-config.tex)
	- "textcomp" to fix warnings with missing font 
	  shapes
	- "scrhack" to fix warnings when using KOMA 
	  with listings package  
o Replaced \mathrm-command with \textrm-command
  (Chapter03.tex)

Changes in version 4.0 (December 2011)
o Due to lots of issues and complaints, 
  classicthesis-preamble.sty is replaced by 
  classicthesis-config.tex (which is cleaner,
  nicer, better, etc. than before!)
o No per-chapter-numbering also for equations 
  (classicthesis.sty and Chapter03.tex)
o classicthesis.sty now also works without the 
  KOMA-classes (scrbook, scrartcl, etc.):
	- This affects the text body shape, where the
	  package "typearea" is always loaded in order 
	  to use \areaset
	- And affects the layout of footnotes where the 
	  package "footmisc" is loaded otherwise
	  (not 100\% identical look-and-feel but OK)
o Help for using spanish babel with classicthesis 
  (classicthesis-config.tex)
o Note about pdfsync issues with graffiti 
  (Chapter01.tex)

  (classicthesis.sty)
