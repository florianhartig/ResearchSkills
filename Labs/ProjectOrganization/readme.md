# Project organization

Keeping your project structured (also on your computer) will simplify your work greatly. A few things that are recommended:

* Keep everything in one main folder!
* Separate subfolders for data, analysis, outcomes / result and writing
* Keep all paths in scripts, R, LaTeX relativ (as in ../data/datafile.RData)
* Ideally, you would then put the whole folder under [version control](https://github.com/florianhartig/ResearchSkills/tree/master/Labs/VersionControl) (it's not neccessary for this course, )

## Template

We provide an exemplary folder structure with some simulated data, basic analysis and plotting, and the implementation of these results in a LaTeX document. For your project, please use exactly this structure. Please read the comments in the Readme file!

* Download template as ZIP [here](https://github.com/TheoreticalEcology/ProjectTemplate/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
* Create a new GitHub project based on template here https://github.com/TheoreticalEcology/ProjectTemplate
